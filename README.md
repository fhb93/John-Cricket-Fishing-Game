Freely inspired by a classic of Brazilian Literature!
It’s the Feast of St John the Baptist, the most traditional popular festival in Brazil's Northeastern region!

As John Cricket you are working in the fishing game booth, which is presenting a new and more challenging version of the old known game this year, with moving fish dolls! Thanks to "marketing" by your best friend Chicó, everybody is interested in giving it a try. To name a few, a kid, the mayor and even the colonel, a fearsome landowner!
As a natural cheater you found a way to rig this game from under the game table. This is the perfect opportunity to gain more commissions because of the happy customers.  So, you will aid them in a way they really believe they are good at this fishing game version, even though they all suck at it. 

Slightly move the fish dolls, while the customers are playing and help them win the prizes in the most subtle way possible. 
Beware that some customers can get more aware and will report your boss about you. Three notices from the boss and you don’t receive any commission.
